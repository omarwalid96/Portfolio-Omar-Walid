      longDescription: "Built a ROS/Gazebo pipeline that automatically tunes local navigation parameters (e.g., costmap inflation radius and cost scaling factor) via a genetic algorithm. The system launches navigation goals through Locomotor/DWB, live-updates parameters using dynamic_reconfigure, and evaluates each candidate with a multi-objective fitness: time-to-goal, collision penalties (Gazebo contact sensors), and front/side local-cost metrics sampled from the costmap. Runs iterative generations with elitism, crossover, and mutation, resetting the world and robot pose between trials. Includes goal progress monitoring via actionlib feedback, AMCL/odometry hooks, and automatic cancellation/recovery on timeouts or failure states. Results are serialized for offline analysis."

      longDescription: "Developing a multi-sensor 3D perception pipeline that fuses depth/LiDAR point clouds with RGB camera data. Point clouds are processed in Open3D for voxel filtering, clustering (e.g., DBSCAN), and object pose estimation using RANSAC/ICP. YOLO-based object detection runs on synchronized RGB frames, with detected classes associated to 3D clusters to add semantic labels. Final results are projected into a local perception map and published to the navigation stack, enabling both geometric and semantic reasoning for obstacle avoidance, path planning, and behavior selection. The system integrates SLAM-based localization with TF2 to ensure consistent transforms across all data sources."

      - title: "Pocket Tank Shooter - Gitex 2023"
        description: "Omni-wheel combat robots featuring both autonomous and VR-controlled gameplay modes."
        longDescription: "Engineered control, perception, and targeting systems for two omni-wheel drive robots showcased in an interactive VR shooting game at Gitex 2023. One robot operated autonomously, using fused odometry from wheel encoders, IMU, and camera-based ArUco marker pose estimation for navigation and aiming. It autonomously detected and engaged targets by calibrating its pitch and yaw mechanisms and dynamically controlling the motorized shooting angle. The second robot was manually operated by a human opponent via a VR headset and joystick, receiving a real-time video feed through WebRTC streaming. The combination of precise omni-wheel kinematics, multi-sensor fusion, and integrated targeting systems created an immersive competitive experience between human and autonomous players."

        longDescription: "Developed a real-time interactive installation where a UR10 Universal Robot engages in a hockey-style game by detecting and reacting to a moving puck. Implemented trajectory estimation using ArUco markers, camera calibration, and high-speed vision processing to calculate puck speed, position, and future path. Designed decision-making logic to classify actions as defensive or offensive, and generated precise 2D plane position commands for the UR10 to execute responsive movements. The system was optimized for accuracy, speed, and audience engagement in a live event environment."
